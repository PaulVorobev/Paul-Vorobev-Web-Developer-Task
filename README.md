Improvements: You might like to suggest some general improvements to the validation method implemented here.
============================================================================================================
Suggested Improvements:
-----------------------
Mark required fields. 
Provide detailed error messages after validation (in-context with the field that caused the error) and provide an example of what the data should look like (as an example: "Email did not match format - name@domain.com").
Display error messages on the page (after the modal dialog box/popup window is closed by user) and highlight the fields that caused the errors.
Check the type of data (in addition to valid format) such as string vs number, ensuring that the value entered is a valid value.
Use server-side validation (in addition to client-side validation).
